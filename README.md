learning-css

This is my first project in which I'm trying to be familiar with web-development trying to know how different features are created with codes . In this project I'm much focus on css to know how to sttyle different elements.

what I have used

 I used HTML and  CSS only to design my new form but I will continually upgrade it until it's fully finished.
